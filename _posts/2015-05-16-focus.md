title: "Two lines in your shell profile to keep you focused"
---

Started using a low tech but effective way block sites to keep my focus. You can use browser extensions but I found overriding the blocked sites DNS to localhost in my hosts file simpler. This way it's cross-browser and handy aliases help you do this easily.

## 1. add host entries for the sites you want to block

```
127.0.0.1 facebook.com #blocked
```

Make sure you also add the comment #blocked.

## 2. add aliases to your bash or zsh profile

```sh
alias focus="sudo gsed -i '/#blocked/s/^#//' /etc/hosts"
alias unfocus="sudo gsed -i '/#blocked/s/^/#/' /etc/hosts"
```

You need GNU sed if you're on a Mac as the old version of sed which comes with OSX doesn't support the -i option. Just use `brew install gnu-sed` to install it.

You might also need to restart your browser to make sure it's DNS cache is cleared.
